A modern, responsive web application that helps you measure and improve your typing speed. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool provides real-time feedback on your words per minute (WPM), accuracy, and typing errors with a clean, accessible interface that works seamlessly across all devices.

Quick Start
You can start using the Typing Speed Tester immediately by opening the index.html file in any modern web browser. No installation, build process, or server setup required.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Subarudevboy/Typing-speed-tester.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd typing-speed-tester

# Open in your browser
open index.html
Alternatively, you can serve the files using any local web server:

# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (with http-server installed globally)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
How to Use
The application guides you through a simple, intuitive typing test experience. When you first load the page, you'll see a randomly selected paragraph displayed in the text area. Click on the input field below the text to begin.

The app starts with a 3-2-1 countdown to help you prepare, then enables the input field for typing. As you type, the application provides real-time visual feedback by highlighting correct characters in green and incorrect ones in red. Your current position is marked with a blinking blue highlight.

The statistics panel updates continuously, showing your current words per minute, total errors, elapsed time, and your personal best WPM (stored locally in your browser). When you complete the paragraph, a results modal appears with detailed statistics including your final WPM, accuracy percentage, and completion time.

Use the Reset button to start a new test with a different paragraph, or click Retry to practice the same text again. The app remembers your best WPM score between sessions and celebrates when you achieve a new personal record.

Features
The Typing Speed Tester includes comprehensive functionality designed to provide an engaging and educational typing experience. The core testing engine calculates words per minute using standard typing metrics and tracks character-level accuracy with real-time visual feedback.

The responsive design ensures the application works equally well on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. The interface adapts intelligently to different screen sizes while maintaining optimal readability and usability.

Visual feedback helps you identify and correct typing patterns through color-coded character highlighting. Correct characters appear with a green background, errors are highlighted in red, and your current typing position is marked with a distinctive blue indicator.

The application includes a curated collection of text samples ranging from classic literature excerpts to modern prose, ensuring varied and engaging practice material. Each test session randomly selects from this collection to keep your practice sessions fresh and challenging.

Local storage integration preserves your personal best WPM score between browser sessions, allowing you to track your improvement over time. The app celebrates achievements when you surpass your previous records.

Accessibility features ensure the application works well with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation. All interactive elements include proper ARIA labels and focus indicators, making the app inclusive for users with different abilities.

The optional dark theme provides a comfortable typing experience in low-light conditions, with your preference automatically saved for future sessions. Sound effects provide audio feedback for countdown events and test completion, though these can be disabled if your browser doesn't support the Web Audio API.

Development Setup
The project uses vanilla web technologies without any build tools or dependencies, making development setup straightforward. You'll need a modern web browser and a text editor to begin contributing.

Start by forking the repository on GitHub and cloning your fork locally. The project structure is intentionally simple with three main files: index.html for markup, styles.css for styling, and script.js for functionality.

# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/Subarudevboy/Typing-speed-tester.git
cd typing-speed-tester

# Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes and test them
# Open index.html in your browser to test

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message"

# Push to your fork and create a pull request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
The CSS uses modern features like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS custom properties (variables) for theming. The JavaScript is written in ES6+ syntax using classes and modern APIs like localStorage and the Web Audio API.

When testing your changes, verify functionality across different screen sizes using your browser's responsive design tools. The application should work correctly on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers.

Contributing
We welcome contributions that improve the typing test experience, enhance accessibility, or add thoughtful new features. Before starting work on a significant change, please open an issue to discuss your ideas with the maintainers.

The codebase follows consistent formatting and naming conventions. CSS classes use kebab-case, JavaScript variables use camelCase, and HTML follows semantic markup principles. Comments explain complex logic and accessibility considerations.

When submitting a pull request, include a clear description of your changes and the problem they solve. Test your modifications across different browsers and screen sizes to ensure compatibility. If you're adding new features, consider how they affect the application's simplicity and accessibility.

Bug reports should include steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and actual behavior. Feature requests should explain the use case and how the proposed feature would benefit users.

We particularly appreciate contributions that improve accessibility, add internationalization support, enhance mobile usability, or expand the text sample library with high-quality content.

Browser Compatibility
The application works in all modern browsers that support ES6+ JavaScript features, CSS Grid, and Flexbox. This includes recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Internet Explorer is not supported due to its lack of modern JavaScript and CSS features.

The Web Audio API used for sound effects degrades gracefully in browsers or environments where it's not available. All core functionality works without audio support.

License
This project is released under the MIT License, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute the code freely. See the LICENSE file for complete terms.
